It is an off-road endurance event traversing terrain much tougher than conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg. Stages vary from short distances up to 800–900 kilometres (500–560 mi) per day. The rough terrain, driver fatigue, and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.\n\nThe event began in 1978 as a rally from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal. Between 1992 and 2007 some editions did not start in Paris or did not arrive in Dakar, but the rally kept its name.\n\nFrom Wikipedia"],

John’s authority fell to its lowest point and when he asked for more money the barons rebelled and forced him to sign the Great Charter (Magna Carta) that greatly limited the monarchical power and established the basis for common law in 1215. John tried to evade the Charter’s provisions shortly after signing it which provoked the outbreak of a civil war known as the First Barons’ War. The rebellious barons offered the English crown to Prince Louis of France who landed in Kent to assist the rebels in 1216. The barons switched sides and attacked Louis after John’s death in 1216 and reissue of the Magna Carta by the regent of John’s successor Henry III, William Marshal. The fighting lasted for about a year resulting in the defeat of Louis of France who gave up his claims to the English throne in 1217 ...\"\n\nFrom https://englishhistory.net"]
